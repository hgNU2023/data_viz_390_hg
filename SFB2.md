The **‘Liberal democracy index’** (variable name: v2x_libdem) in the V-Dem dataset focuses on the importance of **”individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority.”** The liberal democracy index is reported on a scale from low to high (0-1), based on measures such as constitutionally protected civil liberties, a strong rule of law, and checks and balances on executive power. 

The **‘Government censorship effort–Media’** variable (variable name v2mecenefm) is one of the Freedom of Expression measures. This censorship variable is focused on the question “Does the government directly or indirectly attempt to censor the print or broadcast media? In this case, indirect forms include things like giving financial support or preferential treatment to networks or broadcast frequencies. The responses are rated on a scale from 0-4, 0 being the most direct and routine level of censorship and 4 being the most minimal level. Here are the exact level explanations:
        0: Attempts to censor are direct and routine.
        1: Attempts to censor are indirect but nevertheless routine.
        2: Attempts to censor are direct but limited to especially sensitive issues.
        3: Attempts to censor are indirect and limited to especially sensitive issues.
        4: The government rarely attempts to censor major media in any way, and when such
        exceptional attempts are discovered, the responsible officials are usually punished.


My graphs, then, look at the relationship between the liberal_democracy level and the level of censorship within a country. I started by looking at the U.S., a country in which I am familiar with the state of liberal democracy and media censorship. Here are the levels of each of these indicators separately shown over time. These will serve as a base for understanding a further, comparative look into Eastern European countries.


## Starting with a look at the U.S. Over Time:
