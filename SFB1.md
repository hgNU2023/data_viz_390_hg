Violence against women and girls is still one of the most widespread human rights violations in the world––in fact, in March, the UN chief stated that violence against women and girls may be the world’s “longest, deadliest pandemic” (UN News). While it’s such an extensive issue, it is difficult to get up-to-date and accurate data in this area because of the social stigma and potential danger that prevent females from reporting. However, I found a dataset with survey data from the past decade that spans 70 countries. The dataset is from a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which, according to The DHS Program website, is a “nationally representative population-based survey with a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households)” (DHS).

There are many factors that lead to the unjust treatment of women, many of which are known and some of which still need to be studied. To have the best chance at coming up with solutions to the issue of this violence, it is important to dive deep into potentially causal issues. In this dataset, the focus is on the perception of whether a husband hitting or beating a wife is justified. The respondents were given a list of statements and instructed to indicate whether they agree or disagree. The statements were as follows:

“A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife…:
* ...if she burns the food”
* ...if she argues with him”
* ...if she goes out without telling him”
* ...if she neglects the children”
* ...if she refuses to have sex with him”
* ...for at least one specific reason”

I mentioned in my introduction that there is social stigma attached to domestic violence––but what are the intricacies of this social stigma? Who really thinks that violence is deserved, who thinks it is something to be ashamed of, and who is against it? The answers to these questions will help us understand the complex public landscape of a sensitive issue. In addition, a greater understanding of who believes domestic violence is justified will illuminate where social perception needs to change. To bring about a change in societal expectations of gendered violence, it would be extremely helpful to be able to target specific demographics contributing to societal acceptance. So, who are the people who are agreeing with the statements in the survey?

In order to narrow down the dataset for analysis and visualization, I focused on the country of Afghanistan. Therefore, my targeted question is:

Are there societal patterns within Afghan demographic groups that indicate who is likely to agree with the justification of using violence against women in response to various actions?
