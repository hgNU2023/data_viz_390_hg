# Data Visualizaton 390 –– Homepage

My name is Hannah and this is my page for posting my work from **Poli Sci 390: Political Data Visualization**.

A little bit about me:
I am a senior majoring in Political Science with a minor in Data Science. Outside of class, I am involved in a few music groups on campus: Philharmonia, where I play violin, and the Acadmeny of Music and Arts for Special Eduaction (AMASE), where I teach piano lessons. I am also involved in student government––I have been a member of the Academics Committee since my freshman year and I run a grant called the Student Faculty Interaction Grant which funds events for students and professors outside the classroom. I am getting ready to graduate, start my full-time position as a paralegal in January, and hopefully head off to law school in the fall!

A little bit about the blog:
This blog is for the work I have completed for Poli Sci 390: Political Data Visualization. It includes mainly original data visualizations from a variety of sources. As most of the coursework I have taken for Data Science has been in Python and has not been focused on visualization, I hope this blog demonstrates my proficiency in R and my visualization capabilities.
