### US Abortion Policies and Access After Roe

This still is taken from an interactive graph, but for the purposes of this blog post I will comment on this simplified version of the visualization––a U.S. map with a single categorization represented by a range of colors. The visualization is from the Guttmacher Institute, a wonderful research and policy group focused on reproductive health in the U.S. The first thing that drew me to this visualization was the color scheme––I am quite particular about color palettes and I think that data visualization presents a special challenge because each color needs to be easily distinguished from the other. I think that this map is successful both in the tasteful aspect of the color selection and the readability of the color code. There is a lot more information to be analyzed in the interactive version where clicking on each state gives the updated details of abortion policies and access, however this map gives a simple, quick understanding of which states are in general, most restrictive or protective of abortion rights. The simplicity, readability, and tastefulness of the visualization are all reasons why I chose to feature it for my first visualization of a controversial topic.

It takes a second to see it––look again! Did you catch it? The y-axis is upside down! So, while it looks like an oddly shaded in line graph with a drop in murders after the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law was passed in Florida, it is actually displaying the opposite trend. The number of deaths actually spiked after 2005, and from the early 1990s to ~2012 it appears that the number of murders committed using fire arms has dropped about 150. The most glaring issue with this graph is the inverse y-axis––it is non-intuitive and could easily lead to wrong conclusions. While it is important to study a visualization and read it in its entirety, people are not always going to take the time to do so. Therefore, the “first-glance takeaway” of a visualization is incredibly important. From this graph, I take away that I will consider first-instincts and typical expectations of the viewer, as these are important parts of the public-facing nature of a visualization on a controversial topic.
