# Final Project

### How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect childcare options? 

NOTE: My initial proposal was about privacy legislation in the U.S. and how the pandemic (specifically contact tracing) may have affected public opinion on privacy policies. However, when I started looking into this topic, I found a lot of data but most of it was survey data or qualitative data about stages of the legislative process. My research began to shift to other social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the datasets I found was about childcare center closures and I decided to redirect my final project to this topic.


## Introduction:

When I go home for summer, I work as a restaurant server in Maine. Over the recent years, I have met a lot of young moms who were subjected to extremely difficult decisions regarding childcare in the midst of the pandemic. One afternoon, I overheard one of my favorite coworkers break the news to our manager that her young son was on the waitlist at three different daycare centers, but if he didn’t get off a list by the end of the month she would have to give up all her shifts at the (already understaffed) restaurant to take care of her son. 

Stories like the one I overheard were not uncommon during the pandemic. In fact, *millions of women realized they couldn’t sustain their jobs with the lack of childcare options during the pandemic and were forced to leave the workforce* (NCSL). While the pandemic uprooted families and individuals across the world, are there some demographics or geographic areas that felt a shift in childcare options worse than others? Looking into data gathered from the past few years, we can begin to illuminate what happened with childcare closures during the pandemic and who unfairly bears the brunt of dealing with this issue in a “half-changed world.”
