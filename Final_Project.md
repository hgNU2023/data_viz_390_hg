# Final Project
### How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect childcare options? 

NOTE: My initial proposal was about privacy legislation in the U.S. and how the pandemic (specifically contact tracing) may have affected public opinion on privacy policies. However, when I started looking into this topic, I found a lot of data but most of it was survey data or qualitative data about stages of the legislative process. My research began to shift to other social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the datasets I found was about childcare center closures and I decided to redirect my final project to this topic.


## Introduction:

When I go back to my hometown, Yarmouth, Maine, for summers, I work as a restaurant server. Over the recent years, I have met a lot of young moms who were subjected to extremely difficult decisions regarding childcare in the midst of the pandemic. One afternoon, I overheard one of my favorite coworkers break the news to our manager that her young son was on the waitlist at three different daycare centers, and if he didn’t get off a list by the end of the month she would have to give up all her shifts at the (already understaffed) restaurant to take care of her son herself as it was the most viable financial option she had. 

I also should mention that I have worked for three summers as a full-time nanny––one of the more lucrative jobs for late high school and early college-aged kids. I can say that I myself profited from wealthy families who had the ability to pay the high hourly rate for 8-5 in-home help. However, I get a first hand look at how inaccessible and expensive it is to have a nanny––there are only so many nannies available, and they want to make as much money as they can just like everyone else. It’s a simple supply and demand problem––the lack of supply and over-demand allows nannies to select the highest-paying options. During the pandemic, this issue was exacerbated, with more kids out of school and at home than ever before. So, I go back to the limited options of my coworker––what would you do?

Stories like the one I overheard at my restaurant were not uncommon during the pandemic. In fact, *millions of women realized they couldn’t sustain their jobs with the lack of childcare options during the pandemic and were forced to leave the workforce* (Griffin and Frazzini). While the pandemic uprooted families and individuals across the world, are there some demographics or geographic areas that felt a shift in childcare options worse than others? Looking into data gathered from the past few years, we can begin to illuminate what happened with childcare closures during the pandemic and who unfairly bears the brunt of dealing with this issue in a “half-changed world.”

## Starting Out:

I started out by looking at the quantitative data from where my anecdotal introduction to the topic of childcare began: in Maine. I accessed a dataset from OSF, and open source research and data management software, called “U.S. Database of Child Care Closures during COVID-19.” I first zoomed in on my home state to look at the rate of child care center closures. This particular dataset used anonymized and aggregated mobile phone data to track changes in visits to childcare centers on a monthly basis between 2019 as compared to 2020 and 2021 (Lee and Parolin). You can see below that where I’m from, more than 60% of the childcare centers saw a decline in visitation by over 50%, which was this study’s proxy for closures. Whether the childcare center fully closed or had to reduce its capacity greatly because of social distancing and ventilation needs, one can see how disruptive this pattern in childcare centers would be for young parents.

## Is this just an issue in Maine? It doesn’t seem that way…

Next, I looked at Lee and Parolin’s data across the entire U.S. to see if this issue was specific to Maine. As can be seen below, a majority of childcare centers across the U.S. saw a mean decrease of between 25-50%––which indicates the probability for a lot of closures across the entire country, not just in one area.

## When did all of these closures begin?
Let's look at a timeline of 2020. 
![closures_by_month_gg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178058/206836573-c6c14daa-f2b7-466e-8d99-b0a896cdfbd8.png)
From the same dataset, we can look at the timeline of closures. At the beginning of 2020, childcare centers seem to have just about the same amount of traffic as in the previous year. However, unsurprisingly, in March of 2020, centers appear to begin to close. By April, over an astonishing 30% of all childcare centers see less than 50% of the visitation that they did in the previous April. This indicates that around *a third* of all childcare centers have become inaccessible or much less accessible to families in need.
### One of the states we can see with one of the highest mean change rates is California. Let’s take a deeper look at California.
<img  alt = "County map of California showing childcare center closures" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178058/206836564-ee1c748f-a293-45f0-98f0-43685582e0b5.png" width=40% height=40%>
<img  alt = "County map of California showing poverty rates" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114178058/206836635-ae5d5f37-27ea-4ba8-af0b-46c81cc35059.png" width=40% height=40%>
Looking at the overall scale and shading of the California county map, it is apparent that in the majority of California’s counties, 75% of schools were closed or majorly cut their enrollment. Does the closure rate vary in areas that have lower socioeconomic status? We can contemplate this question by giving a look at the second map here that shows the percentage of the total population of each county that lives below the federal poverty line, according to the USDA Economic Research Service ("Poverty"). As shown in the maps, closures affected all areas, despite poverty status. There does not appear to be a very strong correlation here, which shows how the pandemic really affected all people. However, people with lower socioeconomic status had drastically fewer options than more privileged families. 

More privileged families had the ability to shift their career to a remote option and work from home to take part-time care over their children. For example, an occupational therapist PBS interviewed was able to switch up his gig for teaching an online class and found that taking a slight pay cut switching to an online position and caring for the baby at home was more financially sensible than paying for the $2,500 monthly cost of infant care (Ho and Boak).

# How much do low-income families have to spend on childcare?


Below is a graph with data from OECD of the top 10 countries where minimum-wage earning couples spend the highest percent of their household income on childcare ("Net Childcare Costs"). Here we can see that in the U.S., the third highest, minimum-wage earning couples spend **27% of their family income on child care.**

To make matters worse, kids were not able to get their vaccinations at the same time as the rest of the population, which added to the emotional strain of the pandemic. Without vaccinations, kids had to quarantine more frequently and for longer periods of time than the CDC allowed vaccinated people to. Here we can see data from the CDC that shows how few kids are fully vaccinated, and this number was much less  in the past years ("Covid-19 Vaccination Age and Sex Trends").One study published in Frontiers of Psychology stated that “Quarantine's impact on children's behavioral and emotional problems is mediated by parent's individual and dyadic stress, with a stronger effect from the latter”(Spinelli et al.).

Overall, childcare closures during the pandemic appear to be a widespread, financially and emotionally damaging issue. These statistics coupled with personal anecdotes demonstrate that there may be deeper issues with the childcare industry in the U.S. as a whole. Continued data from the pandemic about childcare options, pay rates for nannies versus daycare workers, and further emotional analysis will likely be available soon, and will be important to analyze for the wellbeing of the youth of our country. This blog here only scratches the surface of the dimensional issue, and begins to give exigence for changes in the availability of childcare options.
