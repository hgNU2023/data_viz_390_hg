### Final Project Proposal


Leading Question(s):

What is the current state of U.S. data privacy legislation? 


For the first question, I plan to make a US Map with data from iapp's "US State Privacy Legislation Tracker." Interestingly, this is what the map from iapp looked like in Sept 2021:

And this is what the most updated map looks like (updated 10/7/22)
