# Final Project Proposal


### Leading Questions:

*What is the current state of U.S. data privacy legislation? What is the U.S. population's outlook on the state of tech privacy and how might it have changed during the pandemic?*


For the first question, I plan to make a US map with data from iapp's "US State Privacy Legislation Tracker." Interestingly, this is what the map from iapp looked like in July 2021:

And this is what the most updated map looks like (updated 10/7/22)

This first part will be an updated look on what is actually happening with pieces of legislation across the U.S. to set the groundwork for looking into public opinion on the issue.

For the opinion-based second question about public outlook, I plan to use a few data sets.

First, there is an article from Pew titled "Americans and Privacy: Concerned, Confused and Feeling Lack of Control Over Their Personal Information" that accompanies the "American Trends Panel Wave 49 Dataset" from 2019. The article and dataset can be found here: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/

Here is an example of the type of opinion summary graphs I could make:

After discussing a bit about the takeaways from the general survey data, I will use one more dataset to discuss a few interesting takeaways from the Harvard Dataverse dataset called "Replication Data for: Americans' perceptions of privacy and surveillance in the COVID-19 Pandemic" found here https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2F5UEFP6. This dataset deals particularly with COVID-19 surveillance measures like apps used for contact tracing.




## Overall, my hope is to make a final project in the "Storytelling" category, to walk through where we are at with Data Privacy Legislation and how the U.S. population feels about it.




(An expansion on this project could be a look into public opinion in Europe where privacy legislation is more robust and has been around longer, and making comparisons / predictions for the U.S. based on this. Also, it is possible that I could do this instead of the look into contact tracing.)
